/*
There is an m x n binary grid matrix with all the values set 0 initially. Design an algorithm to 
randomly pick an index (i, j) where matrix[i][j] == 0 and flips it to 1. All the indices (i, j) 
where matrix[i][j] == 0 should be equally likely to be returned.
Optimize your algorithm to minimize the number of calls made to the built-in random function of 
your language and optimize the time and space complexity.
Implement the Solution class:

    Solution(int m, int n) Initializes the object with the size of the binary matrix m and n.
    int[] flip() Returns a random index [i, j] of the matrix where matrix[i][j] == 0 and flips it to 1.
    void reset() Resets all the values of the matrix to be 0.
