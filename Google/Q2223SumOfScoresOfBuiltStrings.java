You are building a string s of length n one character at a time, prepending each new character to 
the front of the string. The strings are labeled from 1 to n, where the string with length i is 
labeled si.
    For example, for s = "abaca", s1 == "a", s2 == "ca", s3 == "aca", etc.

The score of si is the length of the longest common prefix between si and sn (Note that s == sn).
Given the final string s, return the sum of the score of every si.

Example 1:
