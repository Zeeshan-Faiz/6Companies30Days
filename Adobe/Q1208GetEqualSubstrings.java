You want to change s to t. Changing the ith character of s to ith character of t costs 
|s[i] - t[i]| (i.e., the absolute difference between the ASCII values of the characters).
Return the maximum length of a substring of s that can be changed to be the same as the 
corresponding substring of t with a cost less than or equal to maxCost. If there is no substring 
from s that can be changed to its corresponding substring from t, return 0.
