/*
You are given an integer array nums of length n.
Assume arrk to be an array obtained by rotating nums by k positions clock-wise. We define the 
rotation function F on nums as follow:
    F(k) = 0 * arrk[0] + 1 * arrk[1] + ... + (n - 1) * arrk[n - 1].

Return the maximum value of F(0), F(1), ..., F(n-1).
The test cases are generated so that the answer fits in a 32-bit integer.
